A week ago I had the opportunity to work with <a href="http://stacyasher.com">Stacy Asher</a> from the University of Nebraska through the Duke Arts Annex community workshop program. Duke puts on a lot of Arts Annex workshops for their students, and the classes are usually taught by local artists. But I really appreciate the community workshops, which are open to Durham residents as well as Duke students. Stacy Asher's current installation, "Meat/Meet/Mete," uses meat images from grocery advertisements pasted onto Pantone color postcards to encourage reflection on meat consumption.

So this past Sunday afternoon, I sat in the Arts Annex with 4 other women from the Durham area and talked about meat! The women I met were creative and engaged in their community. I was lucky to share a few hours with them, and to create the following meat collages.

The works are in my dorm now and displayed in pairs that make sense to me. All of them hang on the pantone color in a sort of surrealist landscape.

<i>SISTERS</i> is a particularly special piece to me. It was fun to see how my sisters interacted with it: "Tag yourself I'm the runt," wrote Daniela, and Celeste responded, "I'm the juicy one... I'm the tastiest."
