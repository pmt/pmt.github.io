A week ago I had the opportunity to work with <a href="http://stacyasher.com">Stacy Asher</a> from the University of Nebraska through the Duke Arts Annex community workshop program. Duke puts on a lot of Arts Annex workshops for their students, and the classes are usually taught by local artists. But I really appreciate the community workshops, which are open to Durham residents as well as Duke students. Stacy Asher's current work, "Meat/Meet/Mete," uses meat images from grocery advertisements pasted onto Pantone color postcards to encourage reflection on meat consumption.

So this past Sunday, I sat in the Arts Annex with 4 other women from the Durham area and I created 8 meat collages while chatting with them about our lives, pop culture, and meat.
