This semester I decided to get back into printmaking, a hobby I've enjoyed since high school. Then, I did multi-color wood block prints. At Duke, I'm able to explore photo-emulsion screenprinting, a totally unique process from that of wood block printing, but one I also really enjoy. I began learning it for the express purpose of printing on a pair of jeans I no longer wear.

The first pair I made were from an old pair of Urban Outfitters high waisted skinny jeans I had stopped wearing. They're the Blonde jeans, and are made from the typography from Frank Ocean's album <i>Blond</i>, with phrases reading <i>Blonde on Blonde</i>, the Bob Dylan album; <i>Blondie</i>, the artist; and <i>4 Non Blondes</i>, the band. The initial typography (the word Blond in Frank Ocean's album's typography) was a found piece from the print studio, which is why I like to leave my work with the transparencies behind in the Duke print studio, because I have found my own inspiration just spending time in the studio. All the painted details -- the lines, the overlapping circles -- are made with printmaking materials like the lids to the paint containers and the rubber squeegee for pushing the ink through the screen.
